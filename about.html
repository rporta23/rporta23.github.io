                                <p>My name is Rose Porta, and I am currently a senior at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith College</a> studying <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical and Data Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/community-engagement-and-social-change-concentration" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Engagement and Social Change</a>. I love to use data analysis and visualization to tell stories, and I hope to use this skill to contribute to social change by revealing insights that highlight the need for transformation.</p>

                                <p>This past summer (summer 2022), I had the opportunity to intern with <a href="https://womensbrickinitiative.com/" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Womenâ€™s Brick Initiative</a> doing research on diversity and representation in LEGO Minifigures. My <a href="http://github.com/rporta23/WBI" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a> highlights the extreme under-representation of women, non-binary folks and people of color (along with other historically marginalized groups) among toys that are meant to represent everyone. Research has shown that children develop ideas about themselves and the world from a very young age through the toys that they play with, so it is essential that the toys available reflect the diversity of the children who play with them. I wrote a series of blog-style articles detailing our research findings in a way that is accessible to a public audience, which will be published on the <a href="https://womensbrickinitiative.com/wbi-blog/" style="color:#9CC;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WBI website</a> in the coming months. WBI also plans to present our findings at LEGO conferences in the near future.</p>

                                <p>This semester (fall 2022), I have been working on two research projects at the intersection of data science and community engagement work through my courses at Smith College. The first project is sponsored by the organization <a href="https://www.womenatthetable.net/" style="color:#9CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women at the Table</a> and is a team project through my Data Science Capstone course. The <a href="https://github.com/sds-capstone/2022-09-proj7-women-at-table" style="color:#9CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> involves creating an educational resource for more ethical machine learning practices through developing an extensive example of an analysis centered around human rights. The second project is in partnership with <a href="https://www.communityaction.us/head-start-early-learning-programs" style="color:#9CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Action Pioneer Valley Head Start and Early Learning Programs</a> and is through an independent study course. It involves collecting and analyzing data from local colleges and universities on the numbers and demographics of students studying early childhood education. The purpose of the analysis is to provide information to the organization about what their workforce of early childhood educators may look like over the next few years so that they can assess how to plan for the upcoming funding cycle.</p>

                                <p> I am also currently serving as the chair of the Smith College Community Service Organization. I organize events and programming to build community both among students on campus as well as between students and the broader community. One of our major projects this semester has been a no-sew blanket-making project where students made over 40 blankets to donate to folks in need. I piloted this initiative in Fall 2019 and it has continued for three academic years now. I also work directly with the staff team to support the functioning of the Jandon Center for Community Engagement as a whole.</p>

I am a certified 500 hour yoga instructor, and I currently only teach one informal class per week, but I would love to start teaching more often once I have more free time.</p>
